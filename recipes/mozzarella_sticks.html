        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The perfect table snack to serve at parties. Quick and easy to make, these deep-fried mozzarella sticks are the perfect blend of 
            crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
            <li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/3 cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            <li>1(16 ounce) package mozzarella cheese sticks</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            <li>Whisk water and eggs together in a small bowl. Mix bread crumbs and garlic salt together in medium bowl. Blend flour and cornstarch
                together in a third bowl.
            </li>
            <li>Heat oil to 365 degrees F(185 degrees C) in a large, heavy saucepan.</li>
            <li>Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture. Lift it up so excess egg drips back into the bowl.
                Press into bread crumbs to coat. Place breaded mozzarella sticks on a plate or wire rack. Repeat with remaining mozzarella sticks.
            </li>
            <li>Use a spider spoon or a pair of tongs to lower 3 to 4 mozzarella sticks into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds.
                Remove from heat and drain on paper towels. Repeat to fry remaining mozzarella sticks.
            </li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
